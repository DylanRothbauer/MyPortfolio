# Introduction 
The summer of 2024, I had the great pleasure to intern at Heartland Business Systems (HBS) as a Software Engineering Associate. My first project for the summer was to make and deploy a web app portfolio.  
I enaged in front end work using HTML and CSS (with bootstrap), the .Net Core environment with @Razor pages, and deploying with Azure DevOps.
